# RichPackage
Basic R functions: hello(), Rich_StdDev(), Rich_Variance()

Ensure you have internet access. 

Type in console
```
 library(devtools).
```
Type in console
```
 install.github("rtroise89/RichPackage")
```
Type in console
```
 library(RichPackage)
```

You now have access to my package functions. For example:
```
 a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
 Rich_StdDev(a)
```
